**SQLViewer-Golang** is a Terminal User Interface (TUI) designed for browsing SQLite databases and viewing CSV files. It’s built to be responsive, so it looks good on any terminal size, and it’s capable of handling large datasets efficiently thanks to its pagination system, which uses a ring buffer. Whether you’re working with databases or CSV files, this tool makes it easy to explore your data directly from the terminal.

**Key Features:**
- Browse SQLite databases.
- View CSV files.
- Responsive design that adapts to terminal sizes.
- Smooth data navigation with pagination.
